        <p class="lead mb-4">Education Major. The only thing is that am I #1 good with kids, #2 good with teaching (I know that I will learn how to teach kids through school), #3 would I be happy doing it? But, I do have good summer and winter breaks, I would be socializing, every year the students change. This isnâ€™t me but a lot of people have told me that they can see me being a teacher haha. I know that itâ€™s up to me but when I hear from others it sounds more convincing. I do know that I have a childlike personality, meaning I am bubbly and energetic and that I donâ€™t have the largest vocabulary box, which is usually a negative aspect but because children have small ones too Now though, am I patient enough, do i like kids enough, and do i enjoy teaching people? <br><br>

       <br><br> I do not have any experience with Computer Science unfortunately. So, here is something else I wrote instea. I apologize.  Everyone is born and raised differently. It is with these differences that install many implicit biases. Essentially, these biases are opinions and stereotypes that we unconsciously an indirectly place on others. The discussed question surrounding this topic is: are we morally responsible for these implicit biases? Two philosophers named Angela Smith and Neil Levy tackle this question. They both agree with the statement that someone is morally responsible for something if they can be praised or blamed for it. There are two different accounts that stand: the volitionist and the attributionist account. The volitionist view that Levy agrees with means that we are morally responsible for something if that person has the cognitive capacity to acknowledge we have control over that something. Essentially, the power to use the control we have when we are made aware. The atributionist view to contrast that Smith agrees with means we are morally responsible not for the choices but the evaluative judgements we make. To focus on Levyâ€™s argument, I agree with the volitional perspective in that one must be made aware of their actions or beliefs to then have control and be morally responsible for their attitudes.
Levyâ€™s logical reasonings begin with saying that the attributionist account believes that there is an absence of control, and that the volitionist account is a stronger epistemic belief. The side that Smith and perhaps Scanlon (another attributionist) takes is one that cares more about causing a burden upon someone.(Levy) Levy states that we interact with many objects all the time, therefore because our interactions and  moral responsibility requires control, we must be aware of these actions. Throughout his argument, Levy combats the attributionist account, and says how the volitionist side is superior to it because it accompasses more. The volitionist side goes to explain the difference between the bad and the blameworthy attitudes towards agents, while the attributionist side binds the two together to be the same. Something can be bad without being blameworthy (Levy). Levy combats the attributionist account; this side has to prove that attributing an attitude to someone is sufficient in proving that they are responsible for having that attitude. There are three arguments then: character, justification, and apology. 
For character, Levy says that we are not everytime responsible for their characteristic actions. He includes the example of brain damage in Phineas Gage. Through this the attributionist account says that the person is responsible or blameworthy to say if the change is permanent and they reject it. Levy says with the example of a factor that is outside of our control, such as height, that because it is out of our control, we are not morally responsible for it. To be morally responsible we need to have knowledge and in result control.  For justification it occurs when it is inquired that somebody alter their attitude on something. If oneâ€™s attitude is put in the control of themselves, then they are responsible(Levy). Lastly for apology, it is explained by Levy that there are instances where someone is not responsible but nonetheless apologizes to give an explanation as to why they are not in fact responsible. He comes to the conclusion as a whole that we need to be made aware of something, to then have control of it. If that control is gained, then we are morally responsible for our attitudes.
In my opinion, I agree with Levy and the volitionist account. We should only be morally responsible for our attitudes and actions if we are made aware of them. That is, if we are unconscious of them to begin with. I will prove my statement by additionally going along with the character, justification, and apology arguments. Firstly, for characteristics an example would be if someone were to wear shoes in my house. As a person with an Asian ethnic background, it is part of the culture to never wear shoes inside anyoneâ€™s house. If by accident, my friend who is unaware of that cultural aspect were to come over for the first time and wore their shoes inside, they would not be responsible for not behaving as I do in my home. My friend is not morally responsible for being raised differently, but because I would then inform them of the behaviors in my household, they are responsible then for changing and then not wearing shoes in my household. For justification, if they were to say that it is peculiar to take your shoes off before entering the house, then I would ask my friend to explain their stance on it, or to change their attitude. This gives my friend the knowledge and then control to see and accept that it is normal for asian people to not wear their shoes inside. Lastly for apology, if my friend were to come over to my house for a second time, but then would forget to take off their shoes, they are not morally responsible. They can apologize by explaining they are not used to it and will do their best in the future to change though they are not completely certain they will remember to. This means that they are apologizing then for not taking responsibility instead of actually being responsible for their action of not taking off their shoes. To conclude, my friend in this example is only morally responsible when they are made aware of their action of not taking off their shoes. They are able to justify themselves without being morally responsible. Control and knowledge is necessary to be morally responsible.
A potential objection to mine and Levyâ€™s argument that we are not morally responsible for our implicit biases when we are unaware would be that perhaps our judgments should always be responsible. We each have our own opinions and our implicit biases, therefore we should be held accountable for them. When we have characterizations, justifications, and apologies, it is only appropriate to be held responsible for them, and to change when needed. 
To conclude, it is important to be firstly made aware of implicit biases to then be morally responsible for them. There are characteristics, justifications, and apologies which can each be explained as to how something is out of someoneâ€™s control, and therefore they are not responsible for those things. It is important to be open-minded in situations, therefore when someoneâ€™s biases are then challenged, it can be rationally reasoned and quicker to come to a middle ground if the biases greatly vary.
